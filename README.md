# Animal-Empires-TBG
Text based game about human-like animals.
Main goal of a game is to save as much population of animals as possible till the end of a game.

The game is written in pure JavaScript.

First thing to do, is to write a story, with the world rules, and then different branches. 
As for programming, think up of a way to create buttons (story pushers/directions) with values of dialogues choices. 

Example:

An object with "from" point, and buttons "next points":

var line42 = {
	"from": 41,
	"bt1": "Go to hell! I won/'t do that for you",
	"bt2": "I will accept your conditions.",
	"bt3": "Let/'s make a compromise."
 }
